See Figure1for an illustration.\nCombining Transformer, Mamba, and MoE elements allows flexibility in balancing among the\nsometimes conflicting objectives of low memory usage, high throughput, and high quality. In terms\nof memory usage, note that comparing the total size of the model parameters can be misleading.\nIn an MoE model, the number of active parameters that participate in any given forward step may\nbe much smaller than the total number of parameters. Another important consideration is the KV\ncache \u2013 the memory required to store the attention keys and values in the context. When scaling\nTransformer models to long contexts, the KV cache becomes a limiting factor. Trading off attention\nlayers for Mamba layers reduces the total size of the KV cache. Our architecture aims to provide\n                                                          3not only a small number of active parameters but also an 8x smaller KV cache compared to a vanilla\nTransformer.

However, it performed substantially worse than the pure Attention model\nin three common benchmark tasks: IMDB [28], QuAC [5], and NarrativeQA [25]. In contrast, the\nhybridAttention-MambaperformedsimilarlytotheAttentionmodelonthesedatasets.

Forinstance,intheIMDBdataset,answerchoicesare\u201cPositive\u201dor\u201cNegative\u201d. While\nthe Attention model adheres to this format, the pure Mamba model often produces other answers,\nsuch as \u201cVery Good\u201d, \u201cVery Positive\u201d, \u201cFunny\u201d, \u201cBad\u201d, \u201cPoor\u201d, and \u201c3/10\u201d. While these may be\nconsidered correct answers, the difficulty of Mamba to adhere to the format suggests a potential\nproblem. Indeed, toperform successfulin-context learning,it is importantfor modelsto capturethe\ninput-outputformat[30]. ThehybridAttention-Mambamodelfollowstheformatsuccessfully,just\nlike the pure Attention model.\nWe hypothesize that this phenomenon points to a limitation of SSMs \u2013 a potential difficulty in\nin-contextlearning(ICL). Indeed,theabilityto performICLhasbeen linkedtotheemergence ofso-\ncalled induction heads in Transformer language models during training, which perform approximate\ncopying operations that are supportive of ICL [31].  We conjecture that the lack of an attention\nmechanism in the pure Mamba model makes it difficult for it to learn in-context. While Mamba\nmay learn to copy and perform simple ICL when explicitly trained to do so ([16, 32], it is not\nclear if ICL is an emergent capability in SSM as is typical of Transformer models. In contrast, the\nhybridAttention\u2013Mamba modeldoes performsuccessfulICL, even whenonly1 outof 8layers isan\nAttention one.\nAsanecdotalevidenceofanemergentinductionmechanism,wevisualizeinFigure7theattention\nof an example headfrom a 1.3B Attention-Mambahybrid model (no MoE), onan IMDB example\nwhere the pure Mamba failed and the hybrid succeeded.
