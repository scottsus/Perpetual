Taking advantage of both model families, Jamba combines\nTransformer and Mamba layers, at a certain ratio. Varying the ratio of Transformer/Mamba layers\nallows balancing memory usage, efficient training, and long context capabilities.\nA few other recent attempts to combine Attention and SSM modules are worth noting. [50] mixes\nan S4 layer [17] with a local attention layer, followed by a sequence of local attention layers; it\nshows experimentswithsmallmodelsand simpletasks. [16]reportsthatinterleavingMambaand\nattention layers is only slightly better than pure Mamba in terms of perplexity, with models up to\n1.3B parameters. [33] starts with an SSM layer followed by chunk-based Transformers, with models\nup to 1.3B showing improved perplexity.  [12] adds an SSM layer before the self-attention in a\nTransformer layer, while [38] adds theSSM after the self-attention, both showing improvements on\nspeechrecognition.

Based on Hyena, StripedHyena\n[36] interleaves attention and SSM layers in a 7B parameter model. However, it lags behind the\nAttention-onlyMistral-7B[22].

See Figure1for an illustration.\nCombining Transformer, Mamba, and MoE elements allows flexibility in balancing among the\nsometimes conflicting objectives of low memory usage, high throughput, and high quality. In terms\nof memory usage, note that comparing the total size of the model parameters can be misleading.\nIn an MoE model, the number of active parameters that participate in any given forward step may\nbe much smaller than the total number of parameters. Another important consideration is the KV\ncache \u2013 the memory required to store the attention keys and values in the context. When scaling\nTransformer models to long contexts, the KV cache becomes a limiting factor. Trading off attention\nlayers for Mamba layers reduces the total size of the KV cache. Our architecture aims to provide\n                                                          3not only a small number of active parameters but also an 8x smaller KV cache compared to a vanilla\nTransformer.

Forinstance,intheIMDBdataset,answerchoicesare\u201cPositive\u201dor\u201cNegative\u201d. While\nthe Attention model adheres to this format, the pure Mamba model often produces other answers,\nsuch as \u201cVery Good\u201d, \u201cVery Positive\u201d, \u201cFunny\u201d, \u201cBad\u201d, \u201cPoor\u201d, and \u201c3/10\u201d. While these may be\nconsidered correct answers, the difficulty of Mamba to adhere to the format suggests a potential\nproblem. Indeed, toperform successfulin-context learning,it is importantfor modelsto capturethe\ninput-outputformat[30]. ThehybridAttention-Mambamodelfollowstheformatsuccessfully,just\nlike the pure Attention model.\nWe hypothesize that this phenomenon points to a limitation of SSMs \u2013 a potential difficulty in\nin-contextlearning(ICL). Indeed,theabilityto performICLhasbeen linkedtotheemergence ofso-\ncalled induction heads in Transformer language models during training, which perform approximate\ncopying operations that are supportive of ICL [31].  We conjecture that the lack of an attention\nmechanism in the pure Mamba model makes it difficult for it to learn in-context. While Mamba\nmay learn to copy and perform simple ICL when explicitly trained to do so ([16, 32], it is not\nclear if ICL is an emergent capability in SSM as is typical of Transformer models. In contrast, the\nhybridAttention\u2013Mamba modeldoes performsuccessfulICL, even whenonly1 outof 8layers isan\nAttention one.\nAsanecdotalevidenceofanemergentinductionmechanism,wevisualizeinFigure7theattention\nof an example headfrom a 1.3B Attention-Mambahybrid model (no MoE), onan IMDB example\nwhere the pure Mamba failed and the hybrid succeeded.

To\nfacilitate such research, we plan to release model checkpoints from smaller-scale training runs.\nThe largest model we provide with this release has 12B active and 52B total available parameters,\nsupporting context lengths of up to 256K tokens and fitting in a single 80GB GPU even when\nprocessing 140K-token texts.\n   6Some prior evidence suggested that Transformer decoder models do not need positional encodings [19].\nHowever, all existing large scale models do use some sort of explicit position information.\n                                                          12References\n [1]  AmeenAli,ItamarZimerman,andLiorWolf.
