Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-\nbasedreasoning ability,itis underexploredwhether suchabilitycan be\ngeneralized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we\nprovide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large\nlanguagemodelson graphs.Wefirstsummarize potential scenarios of\nadopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs,\ntext-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed\ntechniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor,\nLLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages\nand disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the real-world applications of such methods and summarize\nopen-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude\nwith potential future research directions in this fast-growing field.

Then, add the multiples of 3 and 4 (668 + 501 = 1169), and subtract the multiples of 12 twice (since they were added once with multiples of 3 and once with multiples of 4), resulting in 1169 - 167 - 167 = 835."

This sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 4. The number of terms, n, in an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula n = ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. Thus, n = ((98 - 6) / 4) + 1 = 24."

        "answer": "The restaurant needs to find the smallest integer value of main courses (M) such that the number of possible dinner combinations (M x 2M x 3) equals or exceeds 365 (the number of days in 2003). This results in the equation 6M^2 >= 365. Solving for M gives M = sqrt(365/6), and rounding up to the nearest whole number M results in approximately 9.

However, LLMs are black-box models, which\n      oftenfallshortofcapturingandaccessingfactualknowledge.Incontrast,KnowledgeGraphs(KGs),WikipediaandHuapuforexample,\n      are structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs can enhanceLLMs by providing external knowledge\n      for inference and interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolve by nature, which challenges the existing methods\n      in KGs to generate new facts and represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and KGs together and\n      simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs.\n      Our roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely,1) KG-enhanced LLMs,which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and\n      inference phases of LLMs, or for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2) LLM-augmented KGs,\n      that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding, completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question\n      answering; and3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a mutually beneficial way to enhance\n      both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We reviewand summarize existing efforts within\n      these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future research directions.\n      IndexTerms\u2014Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Generative Pre-Training, Knowledge Graphs, Roadmap,\n      Bidirectional Reasoning.\n                                                                                  \u2726\n1   INTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs)1 (e.g., BERT [1], RoBERTA\n[2],  and  T5  [3]),  pre-trained  on  the  large-scale  corpus,\nhave shown great performance in various natural language\nprocessing  (NLP)  tasks,  such  as  question  answering  [4],\nmachine translation [5], and text generation [6]. Recently,\nthe dramatically increasing model size further enables the\nLLMs with the emergent ability [7], paving the road for\napplying  LLMs  as  Artificial  General  Intelligence  (AGI).\nAdvanced LLMs like ChatGPT2 and PaLM23, with billions\nof  parameters,  exhibit  great  potential  in  many  complex\npractical tasks, such as education [8], code generation [9]\nand recommendation [10].\n\u2022     Shirui Pan is with the School of Information and Communication Tech-           Fig. 1.

        "answer": "Positional embedding is a technique used in the Transformer model to incorporate the sequential order of tokens into the input representation. It is necessary because the Transformer lacks inherent notion of token order due to its non-recurrent nature, so positional embeddings assign a unique vector to each token position to help the model understand sequence information."

Relative Positional Encoding, on the other hand, generates positional values based on the relative positions between tokens, focusing on the relationships and distances among tokens instead of their absolute positions."

        "question": "What is the relationship between GPU memory occupation and the aspects of data like batch size, sentence length, and model dimensions in the context of parallel training?",
        "answer": "The occupation of GPU memory for intermediate results is directly related to the batch size, sentence length, and model dimensions. When using data parallelism, where a batch of data is divided among multiple GPUs, each GPU processes a smaller portion of the data, leading to a reduction in input dimensions and consequently lowering the memory used for intermediate results."

        "answer": "Model parallelism was designed to alleviate memory pressure by distributing model parameters across multiple GPUs. A common example is the linear layer in a Transformer architecture. By partitioning the parameters of a large matrix used in the linear layer into smaller segments that are manageable for each GPU, the model distributes the load and reduces individual memory requirements on single GPUs."

It involves each GPU using a shared set of parameters, and utilizing a reduced scatter operation to manage redundancy in gradient calculations, acquiring just a portion of gradient results. Post gradient update, an all-gather operation synchronizes the updates across GPUs, allowing for the removal of the original gradients from memory, thereby saving GPU memory."

        "answer": "The 'all-gather' operator is used in distributed computing environments, particularly in model and data parallelism, to aggregate sub-results computed by individual GPUs. This operator facilitates the communication and synchronization of these results across all GPUs, ensuring that the final output reflects computations performed on the entire dataset, even though individual GPUs processed different subsets of data."

Finally, the performance of TEMPERA was\nbenchmarked for text classification tasks, whereas RLPROMPT was applied to text generation.\nMore recently, Sun [115] proposed Prompt-OIRL, a framework that uses offline reinforcement learning to achieve\ncost-efficient and context-aware prompt design.

        "answer": "The Plan4MC framework breaks down tasks into basic, short-horizon skills, learns these skills separately, and plans over skills. It uses reinforcement learning to train fundamental skills like 'Find', 'Manipulate', and 'Craft', each with a different algorithm. During online planning, the agent performs a depth-first search on the skill graph to identify a feasible plan, selects policies to solve skills, and reverts to planning if task execution fails."

LLMs are suitable for planners because they can reason about possible skills execution sequences\nbased on their knowledge of the real world.\n7.2   Shortcomings\n7.2.1   LLM4RL\nWhile the available results of theLLM4RL andRL+LLM synergy are impressive and more than promising with regards to\nthepotentialforfuturedevelopment,wecanidentifyasetofshortcomingsofthisclassofproblems,whichrefertotwo\nkey metrics: the applicability of each framework, and the scalability of the process.\nApplicability.   Despite the wide applicability of RL agents in domains like (see subsection 2.3 for more details),\nour review of the work on the LLM4RL and RL+LLM classes reveals that practically all applications of the relevant\nstudies are limited to either benchmarking environments, games, or robotic environments (Tables 5 and 7), a trend\nthat might initially raise questions about the applicability of the synergy to real-world scenarios beyond household\ntasks or games. We can attribute this apparent limitation to three reasons: First, the majority of studies presented in\nsections 4and 6focus on introducingnovel concepts involvingthe use ofLLMs for tasksthat have traditionally been\nperformed otherwise. As proofs-of-concept, they are therefore well-suited to benchmarking environments, like Atari\ngames. Second,before a combined modeling framework is deployedin the real-world, itsbehavior must beextensively\ntestedforsafety,security,andresponsibleAIconsiderations. TheamplitudeofresearchonResponsibleAIonLLMs,\nboth in theRL4LLM domain and in aside from that, serves as a proof that these considerations are taken seriously by\nthescientific community. Therefore, itwilllikely notbelong untiltheLLM4RLclassesencompass practicalreal-world\napplicationsofcontrolsystemsin areaslikehealthcareandfinance. Third,thekey strengthofLLMsthatenablesthis\nsynergy, i.e., theability to convey human sense and preferences restricts, at the same time, the range of applications\nthatcan beaccommodatedbyLLM4RLframeworks. This limitationappliestoboth thespecificationofgoals ordesired\nbehavior through human language, as well as on the representation of the state using natural language [41].\nEven within the realm of the commonly used benchmarking environments, the applicability of LLM4RL methods is\noften constrainedby the limitations ofthe frameworksthemselves. Forexample, some frameworks, such asthe GLAM\nmethod by [22] are exclusively limited to textual environments, while the ELLM method by [41] assumes a natural\n                                                                   20RL/LLM Taxonomy Tree\nlanguage textual representation of the agent\u2019s state.

We have therefore identified three core classes, namely RL4LLM, which use RL to improve the performance\nof an LLM; LLM4RL, where an LLM assists the training of an RL agent; and RL+LLM, where an RL agent and\nan LLM participate in a common framework for planning downstream tasks.  We have further divided each class\ninto subcategories based on observations that differentiate the studies that belong in each one. Since each category\ncorresponds to a distinct type of synergy between RL and LLMs, we have explored the key motivations behind the\ndevelopment of the frameworks included in each category and have explained which key strengths of RL and LLMs are\nutilizedeachtime.

Taking advantage of both model families, Jamba combines\nTransformer and Mamba layers, at a certain ratio. Varying the ratio of Transformer/Mamba layers\nallows balancing memory usage, efficient training, and long context capabilities.\nA few other recent attempts to combine Attention and SSM modules are worth noting. [50] mixes\nan S4 layer [17] with a local attention layer, followed by a sequence of local attention layers; it\nshows experimentswithsmallmodelsand simpletasks. [16]reportsthatinterleavingMambaand\nattention layers is only slightly better than pure Mamba in terms of perplexity, with models up to\n1.3B parameters. [33] starts with an SSM layer followed by chunk-based Transformers, with models\nup to 1.3B showing improved perplexity.  [12] adds an SSM layer before the self-attention in a\nTransformer layer, while [38] adds theSSM after the self-attention, both showing improvements on\nspeechrecognition.

Based on Hyena, StripedHyena\n[36] interleaves attention and SSM layers in a 7B parameter model. However, it lags behind the\nAttention-onlyMistral-7B[22].

Itshouldnotbe usedin\nproduction environments or with end users without additional adaptation.\n2   Model Architecture\nJamba is a hybrid decoder architecture that mixes Transformer layers [46] with Mamba layers [16], a\nrecentstate-spacemodel(SSM) [17,18],inaddition toamixture-of-experts(MoE)module[13,41].\nWe call the combination of these three elements a Jamba block. See Figure1for an illustration.\nCombining Transformer, Mamba, and MoE elements allows flexibility in balancing among the\nsometimes conflicting objectives of low memory usage, high throughput, and high quality. In terms\nof memory usage, note that comparing the total size of the model parameters can be misleading.\nIn an MoE model, the number of active parameters that participate in any given forward step may\nbe much smaller than the total number of parameters. Another important consideration is the KV\ncache \u2013 the memory required to store the attention keys and values in the context. When scaling\nTransformer models to long contexts, the KV cache becomes a limiting factor. Trading off attention\nlayers for Mamba layers reduces the total size of the KV cache. Our architecture aims to provide\n                                                          3not only a small number of active parameters but also an 8x smaller KV cache compared to a vanilla\nTransformer.

While\nthe Attention model adheres to this format, the pure Mamba model often produces other answers,\nsuch as \u201cVery Good\u201d, \u201cVery Positive\u201d, \u201cFunny\u201d, \u201cBad\u201d, \u201cPoor\u201d, and \u201c3/10\u201d. While these may be\nconsidered correct answers, the difficulty of Mamba to adhere to the format suggests a potential\nproblem. Indeed, toperform successfulin-context learning,it is importantfor modelsto capturethe\ninput-outputformat[30]. ThehybridAttention-Mambamodelfollowstheformatsuccessfully,just\nlike the pure Attention model.\nWe hypothesize that this phenomenon points to a limitation of SSMs \u2013 a potential difficulty in\nin-contextlearning(ICL). Indeed,theabilityto performICLhasbeen linkedtotheemergence ofso-\ncalled induction heads in Transformer language models during training, which perform approximate\ncopying operations that are supportive of ICL [31].  We conjecture that the lack of an attention\nmechanism in the pure Mamba model makes it difficult for it to learn in-context. While Mamba\nmay learn to copy and perform simple ICL when explicitly trained to do so ([16, 32], it is not\nclear if ICL is an emergent capability in SSM as is typical of Transformer models. In contrast, the\nhybridAttention\u2013Mamba modeldoes performsuccessfulICL, even whenonly1 outof 8layers isan\nAttention one.\nAsanecdotalevidenceofanemergentinductionmechanism,wevisualizeinFigure7theattention\nof an example headfrom a 1.3B Attention-Mambahybrid model (no MoE), onan IMDB example\nwhere the pure Mamba failed and the hybrid succeeded.
