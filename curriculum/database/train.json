Complying with IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n, the device can use the 2.4GHz or 5GHz channels and provide wireless speeds of up to 450Mbps which is ideal for users seeking a highly robust, bandwidth intensive wireless networking experience, particularly with HD video streaming and online gaming. Dual Band is the latest wireless technology allowing the Adaptor to connect with a 2.4GHz or 5GHz network. This allows you to check e-mail and browse the Internet using the 2.4GHz band or stream HD movies and other media on the 5GHz band. The advantage of working on the 5GHz band is that, unlike the crowded 2.4GHz band shared with microwaves, cordless phones and other wireless networks, it has much less interference and can provide a more stable wireless signal, which is ideal for online gaming and HD video streaming. Both the adaptor's 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands support the maximum speed of up to 450Mbps, which generates a maximum theoretical wireless throughput bringing you a limitless wireless experience. WPA/WPA2 encryption standards ensure your wireless connection is safe from intruders.TL-WDN4800 comes with a CD utility that helps you complete the software installation and wireless network settings, including security configurations and wireless connection, which makes setting up your network so easy that even for novice users should be up and running in minutes.\n\n                            \" ;"

It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.\n\nIntel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.\n\nIdle States are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.\n\nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.\n\nThermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.\n\nExecute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.\n\n                        \n                    \n                                                \n                                            \n                            Short summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor:\n                            This short summary of the HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor data-sheet is auto-generated and uses the product title and the first six key specs.\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130, Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 5000 Sequence, 2 GHz, LGA 771 (Socket J), Server/workstation, 65 nm, 64-bit\n                        \n                                                                \n                            Long summary description HP Intel Xeon 5130 2GHz 4MB L2 processor :\n                            HP Intel Xeon 5130.

But there's far more here than meets the eye. That's because TG-Tracker is part of the Olympus Tough Family - worry-free cameras built to handle abuse so you can concentrate on getting great shots. TG-Tracker is waterproof to depths of 100 ft (30m), crushproof up to 220 lbf (100kgf), shockproof from 7ft (2.1m), freezeproof to 14F (-10C), and dustproof. Most other action cams need protective housings. That means more stuff to carry around, clumsy camera operation, and a difficult time capturing sound. With TG-Tracker, no housing equals better overall performance.\nFor adventurers looking to analyze their activities, switch the TG-Tracker to LOG mode to record the data from the camera's built-in GPS, compass, accelerometer, thermometer, and barometer. The location data from these sensors, such as location, altitude, direction, and temperature, can be viewed on the camera's monitor and downloaded for later use with the Olympus Image Track (OI.Track) mobile app.\n Main Features \n\nUHD 4K Video at 30 fps\nMaximum Lens Aperture: F2\n1080p at 60 fps / 720p at 120 fps\n8MP Photos\n204deg Lens\nWaterproof to 98.4' / Shockproof to 7'\nFreezeproof to 14F (-10C)\nBuilt-In LED Headlamp\nTilt-Out 1.5\" LCD\nBuilt-In Sensors Track Location/Movement\nView Data Logs via OI.Track Mobile App\nRecording Media: microSD/HC/XC\nUnit Dimensions (WxHxD): 1.4 x 2.2 x 3.7\" / 35.0 x 56.5 x 93.2mm\nUnit Weight: 6.35 oz / 180 g including battery and card\n\n What's in the box \n\nOlympus Stylus Tough TG-Tracker Action Camera (Green)\nWrist Strap\nAC Adapter\nUSB Cable\nLens Protector\nUnderwater Lens Protector\nJoint Screw\nMount Coupling\nSteady Grip\nCD-ROM with User Manual and Software\n1 Year Limited Warranty\n\n\n1 Year Olympus Limited Warranty\n\n                    \"  up to 2.5 GHz burst frequency connect and share in more ways than ever before.

F\u00fcr Wanderer auf leichten schnellen Touren \u00fcber mehrere Tage ist es der perfekte Allrounder. Durch Kompressionsgurte kann die Ladung bei nicht vollem Rucksack sch\u00f6n dicht an den R\u00fccken geholt werden. Das macht den Gorilla selbst f\u00fcr Tagesausfl\u00fcge oder Wochenendtouren zu einem sehr flexiblen Begleiter. Wer nicht so viel Ausr\u00fcstung verstauen muss und einige Tage wandern geht, ist mit dem Packvolumen des Gorilla gut beraten. Das Hauptfach fasst 29 L, in die Aussentaschen passen nochmal 11 Liter rein. Das Hauptfach ist mit ca. 7 L erweiterbar, gedacht f\u00fcr Resupply oder Lebensmitteleink\u00e4ufe unterwegs.\u00a0 Wir liefern den \u00fcberarbeiteten Leichtrucksack\u00a0ohne\u00a0H\u00fcftgurt aus. (Den H\u00fcftgurt kaufen sie bitte gesondert, hier bei uns.) Dieser neuere H\u00fcftgurt ist noch ergonomischer und besser gepolstert.\u00a0Die Zip-Taschen sind nun fest integriert. Das Tragegestell besteht aus einem Aluminium-Rahmen in Form eines umgedrehten U, kurz Stay genannt. Der Stay \u00fcbertr\u00e4gt die Last\u00a0direkt auf den H\u00fcftgurt. Er l\u00e4uft unsichbar im Bodenbereich\u00a0aus dem Rucksack raus in 2 Aufnahmetaschen im H\u00fcftgurt. Der H\u00fcftgurt \u00fcbertr\u00e4gt die Last direkt auf die H\u00fcfte. Bis zu 14 kg werden so komfortabel gemeistert. Die Schultergurte sind sehr komfortabel konstruiert, f\u00fcr Frauen und M\u00e4nner gleicherma\u00dfen.Die Fronttasche ist klassisch aus stabilem Mesh mit\u00a0Ripstop-Nylon-Boden. Es ist gro\u00df genug um nasse Tarps oder Zelte zu verstauen. Auf der Rucksack-R\u00fcckenseite befindet sich der Powermesh Mattenhalter. Er nimmt die im Lieferumfang befindliche kleine Isomatte\u00a0auf.\u00a0Entnommen dienst sie zus\u00e4tzlich als Sitzkissen, am Rucksack dient sie als R\u00fcckenpolster. Wer H\u00fcftgurt und Pad nicht braucht, spart auch hier Gewicht\u00a0ein. Das\u00a0Hauptfach-Gewebe besteht aus dem neuen 100d Robic Nylon. Der Boden ist verst\u00e4rkt, teils wird sogar 200d Robic eingesetzt an beanspruchten Stellen. M\u00e4\u00dfig belastete Bereiche sind aus Silnylon gerfertigt. Je nach Beldung kann mit den Seitenkompressionsriemen die Ladung stabilisiert werden. Auch der Gorilla 40 Ruksack hat das bew\u00e4hrte\u00a0OTT(TM) (Over-the-Top) Deckel-Verschluss-System.
